            This tool helps identify the primary admitting service based on the hospital’s
            guidelines. The lists are not exhaustive and should be applied flexibly, with ED
            evaluation, clinical judgment, and relevant comorbidities considered.

              <p>
                The following guidelines specify which inpatient service is primarily responsible for
                accepting patients with certain diagnoses. The list of diagnoses is not a complete one
                and the guidelines are intended to be used flexibly as described. Patients should be
                admitted to the most appropriate service based on the primary diagnosis.
              </p>
              <p>
                In all cases, the Emergency Department (ED) physician is expected to conduct an
                evaluation sufficient to ascertain the need for admission, to determine the appropriate
                admitting service, and to identify significant medical comorbidities if they are present.
                Furthermore, the ED physician has discretion to interpret the guidelines in a way that
                best serves the patient. Discussions about the appropriate service should never take
                place in front of the patient and decisions should be made collaboratively,
                professionally, and in a patient centered manner.
              </p>

            <details>
              <summary>Disagreement / Escalation</summary>
              <p>
                In the case when a service disagrees with an ED attending’s plan to admit the patient
                to his or her service, the chief resident of the service in question may briefly and
                professionally discuss the case with the ED attending.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a disagreement as to the appropriate service/level of care persists, the ED attending
                will wait 30 minutes before placing an admission order to allow the attending on the
                receiving service an opportunity to discuss the decision by calling the ED attending
                directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ultimate decision on admission and to what service and level of care (floor vs SDU
                vs ICU) will remain the decision of the ED attending. Disagreements can be discussed
                with service leadership to resolve individual cases or an overall approach to the
                guidelines.
